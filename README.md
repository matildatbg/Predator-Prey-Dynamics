# Predator-Prey-Dynamics

In this project, the 2D and time dependent Prey-Predator dynamic model was studied by implementing the Galerkin Finite Element Method (GFEM). This was 
implemented in both MATLAB and Python (using the FEniCS FEM-solver).


The project consists of 3 different parts:

Part A - 1D simplification and time independent version of the PDE. MATLAB.

Part B - 2D convergence analysis of both time dependent and time independent versions of the problem. MATLAB

Part C - FEniCS implementation of the full problem, with two different initial conditions. Python.


The report discusses the problems more thoroughly, as well as presents and discusses the results.
